# ChatDemo Application - Interview Task

This is a simple demo application to showcase my coding skills for job applications.

## The Task
Build a chat service (Ã  la Slack). Using your service, users should be able to:
- choose a nickname
- join chat rooms of their own choosing
- send messages to other users.

The service should contain both server and client implementations.
